## React Tic Tac Toe Web Application

This repository contains the source code for a Tic Tac Toe web application built using React. The application features a simple and intuitive interface allowing two players to take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid until one player achieves a winning combination or the game ends in a draw. Key features include dynamic player names, a game log to track moves, and a responsive game board. Dive into the code to explore the implementation of game logic, player management, and user interface components.

Feel free to customize it further to better reflect the unique features and aspects of your project.
